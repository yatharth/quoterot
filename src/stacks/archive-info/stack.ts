// The ArchiveInfoStack just defines a simple table to record some information about the tweets we archive.
//
// It is needed, because when we save tweets, we save them by a particular URL, like https://twitter.com/mrbean/status/364372659274569425748
// While that number in the URL is the tweet ID and never changes, the username might change. It the account does change their username,
//  we wonâ€™t be able to find the link as originally archived, unless we remember the original username.
// Therefore, we keep track of the original username and URL as we saw it when archiving tweets.
