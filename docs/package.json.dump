``@types/node` has typings for things otherwise included in node, but not typed, like `require('fs')`.

When upgrading, keep in mind that the @aws-cdk should have the same minor number. Otherwise, compatability issues arise. This is why I pin versions to the minor number using ~ instead of the major one with ^. Also make sure the version number kept in sync with your computerâ€™s CDK CLI utility.
